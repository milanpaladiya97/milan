    == Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I stop Guest Author posts from showing up on my posts feed?

Our premium version handles this seamlessly.

While the author link ideally should go to the authors web page, your guest author posts will show up as one of your posts. You can get around the list problem by creating a new user called Guest Author. Create your guest author posts under this user or use an author switch plugin to change the registered author. That way, guest author posts will show up under the user "Guest Authors" instead of your account.

= This plugin used to substitute Title Name with Author Name when using Jetpack Publicize. How do I get it back?

This was a bug, but if you were using it as a feature, then you can use this code below.

    add_filter('jetpack_open_graph_tags', function( $og_tags ) {
        $id = $this->get_post_id();
        $author = get_post_meta( $id, 'sfly_guest_author_names', true );
        if ( $author && is_singular() )  {

            $og_tags['og:title']           =   $author;
            // any other tags you want to add here
            // for more examples see https://gist.github.com/natebot/6323846
        }
        return $og_tags;
    });
